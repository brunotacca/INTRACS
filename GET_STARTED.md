# Get Started

This project is composed of two different softwares, the mobile application and the inertial device. The mobile application is developed using mainly Dart language and Flutter as its visualization framework. The inertial device is developed using Arduino and C language.

## Dart & Flutter Installation

If you plan on contributing to the application, make sure to install Flutter that already comes with the full Dart SDK. We recommmend VSCode as the IDE of choice, but of course you can use your favorite one.

* [Install Flutter & Dart](https://flutter.dev/get-started/)
* [Install VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)

## Arduino 

If you plan on improving the actual tinycircuits prototype provided by this project, you have to install Arduino and its IDE. If you plan to make another inertial device to integrate with this project, feel free to go ahead and [ask for help](SUPPORT.md) if needed.
