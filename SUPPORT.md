# Support

This repository is limited to specific questions about project itself. Before engaging into external contact, here goes some tips:

- Please make sure to read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 
- Help us help you! [Talk to a duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)
- Spending time framing a question and adding support links or resources makes it much easier for us to help.

For any subject that you feel it's not fitted (yet) as an issue, you can engage into our [Discussions](https://github.com/brunotacca/INTRACS/discussions), jump in there and lurk, talk to us, and help others. If that is not enough, for general questions and a nice talk refer to the contact channels below:
